# Iron-Rails

Iron Rails is a roguelike train management survival game inspired by the tower defense genre. You are tasked with defending a train as you travel from station to station. As you travel, you will face packs of werewolves hunting for their next meal... YOU!

Explore the station, build and manage your train, and stay alive! Be sure to visit the counting house and saloon at each station where you can purchase cargo and meet the locals. Some of them may even be willing to help you out... for a price.
